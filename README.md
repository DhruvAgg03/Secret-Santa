# Secret-Santa
a fun, no-cost secret santa game that you can play with your friends and family!

## Set-up
You will need to do the following things:
1. Setup a gmail account to host your secret santa game. Do not use your personal account as the code can break, and also because the code will be able to access your emails.
2. Enable less-secure apps on your account. If this option is not available, setup 2-factor authentication on the above account, and create a new app-password.

## Usage
1. Execute handler.py
2. Enter your name, host email id, host email password. These are only stored locally
3. You will be prompted for names and emails of participants. Enter them, and once done, type 'quit'
4. Any time you are prompted with Continue? type 1
5. Once all participants receive 2 emails i.e. Invites! and 'Ho Ho Ho...', all emails will be auto-cleared from host to ensure anonimity
6. Once participants send their "gift-emails", continue to next step. Program will terminate.

## Updates
1. Addition of GUI
2. Support for personal-accounts.
