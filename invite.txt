Ho Ho Ho!

Hello there ##Name##! Hope you are having a jolly, merry christmas.

I am your very own Santa Claus. My elves tell me you have been a good kid this year!

To decide the best possible gift for you, I will need you to write me an email telling me about yourself and how your year was.
Don't worry I am known to work discreetly. Your email will be hand delivered to me by my elves, and burnt as soon as I read it:). I assure you that no one else will read it.
I also love reading long mails, so feel free to write a mail of any length. You can also add attachments to your email.

IMPORTANT:
Just keep the subject of your email as "##Subject##-letter". I get a lot of emails, and need some way of sorting them.

Looking forward to reading about you and your year.

Merry Christmas!
Ho ho ho..

Yours truly
Santa Claus
