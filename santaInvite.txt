Hi there ##Name##,

Hope you are having a good day. Thanks for taking part in ##Subject##.

Your santee(is that a word?) i.e. the person you will be gifting to is
...
##RecipientName##
...

I have sent you the mail they sent to their secret santa. Got through it, and write to them a letter as a gift. Send it to me over email, and I will forward it to them as it is!

Also, preferably add some drawing, or anything creative as an attachment(put some effort!)

IMPORTANT:
Send the mail to me with the subject "##Subject##-gift". I'll personally hand it over to ##RecipientName##.

Also, don't worry, I will delete the mail as soon as I have sent it over. Your mail will only be read by ##RecipientName##.

Regards
Santa Claus
